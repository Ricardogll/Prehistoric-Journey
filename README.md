# Prehistoric Journey

A little 2D Platformer made by two students on second year of CITM UPC of Terrassa.

For now we have two levels where the player can move around, jump and climb lianas on the first level and rocks on the second one.

For this game we used C++, using SDL and pugi libraries. The maps have been made using Tiled.

### Controls

- Left  (A)

- Right (D)

- Jump  (Espace)

- Climb (W,A,S,D). Press W when you are on top of a climbable part of the map to make the player grab onto it.

- Plus and minus in the keypad to change the volume

- Esc to close the game

### Debug Controls

-F1:  Start at the very first level

-F2:  Start at the second map

-F5:  Save the current state

-F6:  Load the previous state

-F9:  Draw colliders

-F10: God Mode

*Note: You won't be able to save or load while the game is changing scenes to avoid errors.*

## Innovation

- Camera culling, only printing what the camera sees at the moment.

- Volume changing mid-game with keypad plus and minus.
